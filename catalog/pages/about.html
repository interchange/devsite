	<h1>About Interchange</h1>

<p>
__IC__ is an open source ecommerce system and application server/​component
application, written in the Perl programming language. Interchange is one
of the most powerful tools available to
automate and database-​enable your web site or build online applications.
</p>

<p>
At its core, __IC__ is a flexible and high-​performance application server
that handles state and session management, authentication, click
trails, filtering, URL encoding, security policy, and much more.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ is well suited for a variety of purposes, and has been set up
to perform
	sales,
	order processing,
	content management,
	customer service,
	reporting and analysis,
	personalization,
	traditional retail sales,
	digital goods delivery,
	B2B parts re-ordering,
	auctions,
	order status checking,
	supply chain management,
	project management,
	online collaboration, and even
	an MP3 jukebox.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ is geared towards security. With the thousands of Interchange
catalogs out there, we know of no huge security incidents. Some notable
features are SQL-​injection protection, configurable “secure” (HTTPS)
pages, good credit card information handling policies, GPG/​PGP support,
cross-​site scripting protections, support for connecting to multiple databases
from the same application, and system-​defined filters for user input validation.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ can be used as a completely self-​contained standalone product, or
as part of a larger system. It can be integrated with payment processing
services, ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems, point-​of-​sale systems, accounting systems, external
content management systems, other application servers, sales force
automation systems, CRM (customer relationship management) systems, email
campaign management systems, and remote databases on virtually any platform.
</p>

<p>
If you need functionality that __IC__ doesn’t yet provide, you can
incorporate it yourself in an extensible way that survives upgrades. If you
don’t have the time or expertise to do so, there is a strong group of
consultants both present on the
__PUBLIC_MLS__
and available for complete [page support]Commercial Consultancy and
Support</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of people use __IC__ and it has taken hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of orders in its time. But there is a definite learning curve
required to customize __IC__. If you are looking to Interchange for e-commerce,
and all you have to sell is a few simple items, it may well be overkill for your
needs. If you, however, need a sophisticated ordering or content-​management
system with unlimited room to grow, __IC__ may be right for you.
</p>

	<h1>The History of Interchange</h1>

<p>
__IC__ is a descendent of Vend, an e-commerce solution originally developed by Andrew Wilcox in early 1995. __mheins__ took the first publicly-​released version, Vend 0.2, and added searching and DBM catalog storage features to create MiniVend. Mike released MiniVend 0.2m7 on December 28, 1995. Subsequent versions of MiniVend took parts from Vend 0.3, especially the <tt>vlink</tt> and <tt>Server.pm</tt> modules, which were adapted to run with MiniVend. In the four years that followed, __mheins__ expanded and enhanced MiniVend, creating a powerful and versatile e-commerce development platform. MiniVend grew to support thousands of businesses and their e-commerce sites.
</p>

<p>
Separately, an experienced e-commerce development team founded Akopia. Their goal was to create a sophisticated open source e-commerce platform that was both feature-​rich and easy to use. Their product, Tallyman, was intuitive, and had great content-​management features, but lacked many of MiniVend’s capabilities.
</p>

<p>
Akopia acquired MiniVend in June 2000. Mike Heins and the Tallyman developers combined MiniVend 4 with Tallyman’s features to create __IC__, which replaced both MiniVend and Tallyman. In order to preserve compatibility, it was decided that the name “MiniVend” and prefixes like <tt>mv_</tt> and <tt>MVC_</tt> continue to appear in source code and configuration files. __IC__’s first stable release was version 4.6.
</p>

<p>
In January 2001, Red Hat acquired Akopia and created its new E-Business Solutions Division. Red Hat sponsored the development of __IC__ 4.8 and the Red Hat E-Commerce Suite.
</p>

<p>
In mid-2002 Red Hat stopped supporting __IC__ development, and a group of individuals formed the __ICDEVGROUP__ to coordinate Interchange development independent of any company or person. The first stable release by the new independent group of developers was __IC__ 5.0.
</p>

<p>
In 2004/2005, __IC__ documentation system was completely redesigned
in an attempt to achieve better output results and bring the documentation
up to date.
See page [page docs]documentation</a>.
</p>

<p>
Today,
__IC__ continues to be well-​maintained and supported, with new integrations and features being added as needed. The current stable
__IC__ release is __STABLE__, and the current development release is __DEVEL__.

__IC__ throughout the years are listed on page [page devel/people]people</a>.
