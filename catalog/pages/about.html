<h1>About Interchange</h1>

<p>
__IC__ is an open source ecommerce system and application server/​component application, written in the Perl programming language. __IC__ is a powerful tool to automate and database-​enable your web site.
</p>

<p>
At its core, __IC__ is a flexible and high-​performance web application server that handles state and session management, authentication, click trails, filtering, URL encoding, security policy, and much more.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ is well suited for a variety of purposes, and has been set up to perform
	sales,
	order processing,
	content management,
	customer service,
	reporting and analysis,
	personalization,
	traditional retail sales,
	digital goods delivery,
	B2B parts re-ordering,
	auctions,
	order status checking,
	supply chain management,
	project management,
	online collaboration, and even
	an MP3 jukebox.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ is geared towards security. With the thousands of __IC__ applications out there, we know of no huge security incidents. Some notable features are protection again SQL injection and XSS (cross-​site scripting) vulnerabilities, configurable “secure” (HTTPS) pages, good credit card information handling policies, GnuPG/​PGP support, support for connecting to multiple databases from the same application, and system-​defined filters for user input validation.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ can be used as a completely self-​contained standalone product, or
as part of a larger system. It can be integrated with payment processing
services, ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems, point-​of-​sale systems, accounting systems, external
content management systems, other application servers, sales force
automation systems, CRM (customer relationship management) systems, email
campaign management systems, and remote databases on virtually any platform.
</p>

<p>
If you need functionality that __IC__ doesn’t yet provide, you can
incorporate it yourself in an extensible way that survives upgrades. If you
don’t have the time or expertise to do so, there is a strong group of
consultants present in the [page users/community]user community</a>
and available for complete [page support]commercial consultancy and support</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of people use __IC__ and it has taken hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of orders. But there is a definite learning curve
required to customize __IC__. If you are looking to __IC__ for e-commerce,
and all you have to sell is a few simple items, it may well be overkill for your
needs. If you, however, need a sophisticated ordering or content-​management
system with unlimited room to grow, __IC__ may be right for you.
</p>

<h1>The History of Interchange</h1>

<p>
__IC__ is a descendent of Vend, an e-commerce solution originally developed by Andrew Wilcox in early 1995. __mheins__ took the first publicly-​released version, Vend 0.2, and added searching and DBM catalog storage features to create MiniVend. Mike released MiniVend 0.2m7 on December 28, 1995. Subsequent versions of MiniVend took parts from Vend 0.3, especially the <tt>vlink</tt> and <tt>Server.pm</tt> modules, which were adapted to run with MiniVend. In the four years that followed, __mheins__ expanded and enhanced MiniVend, creating a powerful and versatile e-commerce development platform. MiniVend grew to support thousands of businesses and their e-commerce sites.
</p>

<p>
Separately, an experienced e-commerce development team founded Akopia. Their goal was to create a sophisticated open source e-commerce platform that was both feature-​rich and easy to use. Their product, Tallyman, was intuitive, and had great content-​management features, but lacked many of MiniVend’s capabilities.
</p>

<p>
Akopia acquired MiniVend in June 2000. Mike Heins and the Tallyman developers combined MiniVend 4 with Tallyman’s features to create __IC__. In order to preserve compatibility, it was decided that the name “MiniVend” and prefixes like <tt>mv_</tt> and <tt>MVC_</tt> continue to appear in source code and configuration files. __IC__’s first stable release was version 4.6.
</p>

<p>
In January 2001, Red Hat acquired Akopia and created its new E-Business Solutions Division. Red Hat sponsored the development of __IC__ 4.8 and the Red Hat E-Commerce Suite.
</p>

<p>
In mid-2002 Red Hat stopped supporting __IC__ development, and its core developers formed the __ICDEVGROUP__ to coordinate development independently. Their first stable release was __IC__ 5.0.
</p>

<p>
In 2004/2005, the __IC__ documentation system was completely redesigned in to achieve better output results and bring the documentation up to date.
</p>

<p>
Around 2007 Stefan Hornburg spearheaded a new __IC__ catalog template called WellWell, with a number of contributors and users.
</p>

<p>
From around 2009 through 2015 possible future directions for __IC__ were discussed and experiments developed. An incompatible new __IC__ 6 was begun, code-​named first Bongo and then Nitesi. It “stands on the shoulders of giants” such as Plack/​PSGI, Dancer, CPAN modules, and modern Perl, and uses UTF-8 throughout. Plugins provide additional functionality like payment gateways, coupons, shipping calculation, reviews, etc. While it was used on a couple of production sites, it never became a general replacement for __IC__ 5.
</p>

<p>
Today, __IC__ 5 continues to power many busy ecommerce sites. It is well-​maintained and supported, with new integrations and features being added as needed. The current stable release is version __STABLE__. See [page download]the download page</a> to access the source code repository and package downloads now!
