<h1>About Interchange</h1>

<p>
__IC__ is an open source ecommerce system and application server/​component application, written in the Perl programming language. __IC__ is a powerful tool to automate and database-​enable your web site.
It is distributed under the [page license]GNU GPL version 2</a>.
</p>

<p>
At its core, __IC__ is a flexible and high-​performance web application server that handles state and session management, authentication, click trails, filtering, URL encoding, security policy, and much more.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ is well suited for a variety of purposes, and has been set up to perform
	sales,
	order processing,
	content management,
	customer service,
	reporting and analysis,
	personalization,
	traditional retail sales,
	digital goods delivery,
	B2B parts re-ordering,
	auctions,
	order status checking,
	supply chain management,
	project management,
	online collaboration, and even
	an MP3 jukebox.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ is geared towards security. With the thousands of __IC__ applications out there, we know of no huge security incidents. Some notable features are protection against SQL injection and XSS (cross-​site scripting) vulnerabilities, configurable “secure” (HTTPS) pages, good credit card information handling policies, GnuPG/​PGP support, support for connecting to multiple databases from the same application, and system-​defined filters for user input validation.
</p>

<p>
__IC__ can be used as a completely self-​contained standalone product, or
as part of a larger system. It can be integrated with payment processing
services, ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems, point-​of-​sale systems, accounting systems, external
content management systems, other application servers, sales force
automation systems, CRM (customer relationship management) systems, email
campaign management systems, and remote databases on virtually any platform.
</p>

<p>
If you need functionality that __IC__ doesn’t yet provide, you can
incorporate it yourself in an extensible way that survives upgrades. If you
don’t have the time or expertise to do so, there is a strong group of
consultants present in the [page users/community]user community</a>
and available for complete [page support]commercial consultancy and support</a>.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of people use __IC__ and it has taken hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of orders. But there is a definite learning curve
required to customize __IC__. If you are looking to __IC__ for e-commerce,
and all you have to sell is a few simple items, it may well be overkill for your
needs. If you, however, need a sophisticated ordering or content-​management
system with unlimited room to grow, __IC__ may be right for you.
