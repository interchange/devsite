__IC__ is a descendent of Vend, an e-commerce solution originally developed by Andrew Wilcox in early 1995. __mheins__ took the first publicly-released version, Vend 0.2, and added searching and DBM catalog storage features to create MiniVend. Mike released MiniVend 0.2m7 on December 28, 1995. Subsequent versions of MiniVend took parts from Vend 0.3, especially the <tt>vlink</tt> and <tt>Server.pm</tt> modules, which were adapted to run with MiniVend. In the four years that followed, __mheins__ expanded and enhanced MiniVend, creating a powerful and versatile e-commerce development platform. MiniVend grew to support thousands of businesses and their e-commerce sites, and sites running on MiniVend 4 are still common today.
</p>
<p>
Separately, an experienced e-commerce development team founded Akopia. Their goal was to create a sophisticated open source e-commerce platform that was both feature-rich and easy to use. Their product, Tallyman, was intuitive, and had great content-management features, but lacked many of MiniVend's capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Akopia acquired MiniVend in June 2000. Mike Heins and the Tallyman developers combined MiniVend 4 with Tallyman's features to create __IC__. __IC__ replaced both MiniVend and Tallyman. In order to preserve compatibility, it was decided that the name "MiniVend" and prefixes like <tt>mv_</tt> and <tt>MVC_</tt> continue to appear in source code and configuration files. __IC__'s first stable release was version 4.6.
</p>
<p>
In January 2001, Red Hat acquired Akopia and created its new E-Business Solutions Division. Red Hat sponsored the development of __IC__ 4.8 and the Red Hat E-Commerce Suite.
</p>
<p>
In mid-2002, Red Hat decided to stop supporting __IC__ development, and a group of individuals formed the __ICDEVGROUP__ to coordinate Interchange development independent of any company or person. The first stable release by the new independent group of developers was __IC__ 5.0.
</p>
<p>
Today, 
__IC__ continues to florish, the user community is constantly growing, and new __IC__ installations are being frequently deployed. Current stable
__IC__ release is __STABLE__. For __IC__ source code and download, see 
page [page download]download</a>.
</p>

<p>
In July 2004, __ICDEVGROUP__ accepted a new member, Davor Ocelic, who
completely redesigned the __IC__ documentation system and continues to 
maintain it. See the [page docs]documentation</a> page.
