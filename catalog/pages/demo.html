	<h1>Interchange Live Demo's</h1>

<p>
There are two demonstration versions of Interchange hosted by the ICDEVGROUP. These demonstration sites give some idea of what Interchange can do for you. It is by all means not all that Interchange is capable of!
</p>
<h2>User-Modifiable Demo</h2>
<p>This is a completely modifiable __DEMO1__ and may be broken in various ways as users try changing different settings.</p>
<p>To access the administration section of the demo store, enter username <b>demo</b> and password <b>demo</b> when prompted. Store data, included pages, items, pricing, and orders, will automatically reset to the defaults periodically.</p>

<h2>View-Only Demo</h2>
<p>This __DEMO4__ is the same as the user-modifiable demo, with the exception that there is no administrative access granted. This should ensure that it looks and functions just as a freshly built Interchange installation.</p>
