	<h1>Interchange Live Demos</h1>

<p>
Demonstration catalogs could give you an idea of what __IC__ can do for you.
Our standard demo is what most people base their sites on, but it is by
no means all that Interchange is capable of!
</p><p>
There are two variants of our standard demo catalog available for preview:
the user-modifiable demo, and the view-only demo.
</p>

<h2>User-Modifiable Demo</h2>
<p>This is a completely modifiable __DEMO1__ and may therefore be broken 
at times (as users change different privileged settings). However, the catalog
is periodically reset to the default values.</p>
<p>To access the administration section of the demo store, enter username
<b>demo</b> and password <b>demo</b> when prompted.
</p>

<h2>View-Only Demo</h2>
<p>
This __DEMO4__ is the same as the user-modifiable demo, with the exception
that there is no administrative access granted. This should ensure that it
always looks and functions just as a freshly built Interchange installation.
