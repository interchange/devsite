<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<h2>5.x Branch</h2>

<p>Interchange 5.x is the backward-compatible branch and will have new releases for as long as the core team is still supporting it, for many more years given the large number of serious ecommerce sites running successfully on it.</p>

<p>Useful new features continue to be added, along with maintenance updates to keep pace with the changing world of ecommerce.</p>


<h2>6.x Branch</h2>

<p>
Interchange 6 is completely new, built on top of modern Perl, a modern web framework, and CPAN modules. Rather than being a complete application server as Interchange 5 and earlier are, it is an application that "stands on the shoulders of giants" such as Plack/PSGI, <a href="http://www.perldancer.org/">Dancer</a>, CPAN modules, and Perl 5.10.1 or newer. It uses UTF-8 throughout. Plugins provide additional functionality like payment gateways, coupons, shipping calculation, reviews, etc.
</p>

<p>
Its code name is Nitesi, and while it is already being used on some production sites, it is still under heavy development.
