<h1>Roadmap</h1>

<h2>5.x Branch</h2>

<p><small>
Backwards compatibility level: high.
</small></p>

<p>
Interchange 5.x is the backward-compatible branch and will have new releases for as long as the core team is still supporting it, most likely for many more years given the large number of serious ecommerce sites running successfully on it.
</p>


<h2><a name="bongo">6.x Branch</a></h2>

<p><small>
Backwards compatibility level: low.
</small></p>

<p>
Interchange 6 is completely built new on top of modern Perl, modern Perl frameworks and CPAN modules. Rather than being a complete application server as Interchange 5 and earlier are, it is an application built on Plack/PSGI, <a href="http://www.perldancer.org/">Dancer</a>, CPAN modules, and requiring Perl 5.10.1 or newer, using UTF-8 throughout, etc. Plugins provide additional functionality like payment gateways, coupons, shipping calculation, reviews, etc.
</p>

<p>
This work is still under heavy development.
