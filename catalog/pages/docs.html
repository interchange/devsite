<h1>Building documentation from source</h1>
<p>
You can browse __XMLDOCS_CVSWEB__ documentation sources on-line using
__CVSWEB__. To build it yourself, you need to check-out a copy from the
CVS to your local machine:
<pre>
cvs -z6 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.icdevgroup.org:/var/cvs \
  checkout -P xmldocs
</pre>
Then read file
<a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/xmldocs/README">README</a>
for build instructions and pre-requirements.
</p>

<h1>Helping with the documentation</h1>
<p>
There are many ways how you can help with the documentation.
[comment]
The simplest one
includes browsing our on-line documentation and submitting feedback forms
found at the bottom of the pages. Using feedback forms, you can notify us
of smaller errors, request clarification, or you can express your
satisfaction with the page content.<br/><br/>
As you might know, we're currently in the process of wading through 
the <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/mailman/listinfo/interchange-users">interchange-users</a> mailing list archives in search of useful information
that never made it to the documentation. This requires an enormous amount 
of work, due to large number of user posts and spam that added up over the
years. We want
to bring attention of the users' community to the problem.
By registering on our site, you obtain access to a conveniently sorted lists
of mailing list posts which allow you to quickly read and rate individual posts.
By doing a good work (eliminating spam and "dry" messages, or bringing our
attention to useful posts) you will not only help us a great deal, but also 
earn yourself a recognition and public acknowledgement with __ICDEVGROUP__.
