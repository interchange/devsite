	<h1>DOCS - Old Interchange documentation</h1>

<p>
The traditional (old) documentation set is available on
<a href="/interchange-doc-5.2.0/">http://www.icdevgroup.org/interchange-doc-5.2.0/</a>.
</p><p>
You might be aware that the documentation sources can also be
found in the
<a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/docs/">Interchange 'docs' CVS module</a>,
but should only be used in the transition period until the new documentation
is officially released.<br/>
</p>

<h1>XMLDOCS - New Interchange documentation</h1>

<p>
In 2004 and 2005, __ICDEVGROUP__ started a complete __IC__ documentation
redesign; the effort is known as the <tt>XMLDOCS</tt> project.
</p><p>
<tt>xmldocs</tt> set is based on __DOCBOOK__ XML. Large amount of 
documentation is generated by special scripts that parse __IC__ source 
and extract key information for any particular __IC__ release.
<tt>xmldocs</tt> were also designed with "profiling" in mind, a convenient
feature allowing us to produce documentation sets "optimized" for each
target distribution (tarball, Debian GNU, Red Hat ...).
<tt>xmldocs</tt> also support on-line examples when you read the documentation
directly off of our web site.
</p>
<p>
Finally, note that our on-line documentation pages also contain feedback
links; do not miss the great opportunity to open your account, submit comments
and information requests, and rate existing documentation.
</p>

<h1>Reading <tt>xmldocs</tt> documentation on-line</h1>
<p>
The ALPHA-quality XMLDOCS documentation is available on-line
in the following flavors:
<ul>
<li><a href="/docs/">Generic documentation, static</a></li>
<li>Generic documentation, with on-line examples</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Downloading <tt>xmldocs</tt> documentation</h1>
<p>
The documentation is available for download in the following flavors:
<ul>
<li>Generic (tarball) documentation, static</li>
<li>Debian GNU-profiled documentation, static</li>
<li>Red Hat-profiled documentation, static</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Building documentation from source</h1>
<p>
You can browse __XMLDOCS_CVSWEB__ documentation sources on-line using
__CVSWEB__. To build it yourself, you need to check-out a copy from the
CVS to your local machine:
<pre>
cvs -z6 -d :pserver:cvs@cvs.icdevgroup.org:/var/cvs \
  checkout -P xmldocs
</pre>
Then read file
<a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/xmldocs/README">README</a>
for build instructions and pre-requirements.
</p>

<h1>Helping with the documentation</h1>
<p>
There are many ways how you can help with the documentation.
[comment]
The simplest one
includes browsing our on-line documentation and submitting feedback forms
found at the bottom of the pages. Using feedback forms, you can notify us
of smaller errors, request clarification, or you can express your
satisfaction with the page content.<br/><br/>
As you might know, we're currently in the process of wading through 
the <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/mailman/listinfo/interchange-users">interchange-users</a> mailing list archives in search of useful information
that never made it to the documentation. This requires an enormous amount 
of work, due to large number of user posts and spam that added up over the
years. We want
to bring attention of the users' community to the problem.
By registering on our site, you obtain access to a conveniently sorted lists
of mailing list posts which allow you to quickly read and rate individual posts.
By doing a good work (eliminating spam and "dry" messages, or bringing our
attention to useful posts) you will not only help us a great deal, but also 
earn yourself a recognition and public acknowledgement with __ICDEVGROUP__.

You can check-out a copy from CVS as shown above and work on
providing us with <tt>diff</tt> patches to the CVS.
For an introduction to our build system and ways to write documentation, see
files
<a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/xmldocs/README">README</a>
and
