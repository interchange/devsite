00019							20070207		20070207	racke	racke@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.4.2 released	The Interchange Development Group is pleased to announce the releaseof Interchange 5.4.2, the latest production-ready version of our webapplication server. This is a maintenance release and upgrading fromInterchange 5.4.0 should present no compatibility problems.The main changes are:* Fixed a DoS exploit caused by carefully crafted HTTP POST requests.* Worked around apparent Perl bug that allowed code called by DispatchRoutines to overwrite the routines arrays themselves.* Fixed [sql-quote] sub-tag of the [query] tag, which didn't work for multi-line column data.* Fixed masking of unencrypted credit card numbers to work with a custom MV_CREDIT_CARD_INFO_TEMPLATE that does not match the regexp. Also fixed the regexp so it removes the CVV2 value from the unencrypted data.* Fixed shipping problem with the temporary mv_shipping cart, which could cause trouble in cart recalculations.* Made get_option_hash return a copy when passed a reference.* Don't run check_sub on POSTAUTH for Linkpoint.* Made &amp;and and &amp;or profile commands work when alone on a line between two profile checks.* Increased XHTML compatibility and fixed some CSS.* Various admin, Standard demo, and Debian package fixes.Stefan Hornburg (Racke)Interchange Development Group
00018							20060828		20060828	racke	racke@icdevgroup.org		New Developers pajamian and thunder	Two new developers recently joined the ICDEVGROUP, Peter Ajamian aka pajamian and Gert van der Spoel aka thunder.Peter Ajamian is originally from Southern California and now resides in New Zealand. His Interchange experience dates back till 2002. He helped out several people on the mailing list and supplied a couple of patches for Interchange. Peter's first submission as an Interchange developer was the integration of the NetBilling payment gateway.Gert van der Spoel is a Dutch developer who started with Interchange in 1999. Gert freshly opened up a company in Greece. He contributed the Greek translation for the UI and plans to work on the UTF-8 integration for Interchange.Both are regulars on the interchange IRC channel at irc.icdevgroup.org.
00017							20060526		20060526	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.4.1 released	The Interchange Development Group is pleased to announce the releaseof Interchange 5.4.1, the latest production-ready version of our webapplication server. This is a maintenance release and upgrading fromInterchange 5.4.0 should present no compatibility problems.The main changes are:* Fixed bugs in the ITL parser that can cause an infinite loop whenmalformed ITL opening tags are encountered.* Fixed a regression in htmlarea widget which kept it from working withInternet Explorer and browsers claiming to be compatible.* Fixed a profile parsing bug when a comment immediately precedes the__NAME__ identifier.* Check for "GoogleBot", rather than just "Google", in the default RobotUAlist, to prevent confusion with other UA values such as "GoogleToolbar".* Improvements to Linkpoint and VeriSign payment modules.* Support recent versions of mod_perl 2 in Interchange::Link.* Updated UPS Postal rates in Standard demo's shipping tables.* Numerous minor bugfixes in core code, tags, the admin, and theStandard demo.Jon JensenInterchange Development GroupPGP key: http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/keys/jon-jensen-dccac084.txt
00016							20060328		20060328	docelic	docelic@icdevgroup.org		Improved search system on www.icdevgroup.org	Interchange users,We've improved the searching functionality on our site, http://www.icdevgroup.org/. For example, try searching for 'DisplayErrors' or 'html2text'; you'll notice the result category name in the first column, and an extended description field.For mailing list posts, the mentioned system will also print the date.The majority of work was done by Stefan Hornburg (Racke).Have fun!
00015							20060327		20060327	docelic	docelic@icdevgroup.org		[/page] and [/order] macros	Interchange users,Among other incompatible changes we're preparing for the Interchange 6.0 release, there is one worth the final reminder.Namely, we've removed the [/page] and [/order] macros which were with us for a very long time and do make a piece of Interchange history.The intention to remove them was known a couple of releases back. So if you happen to have used the two macros, replace both of them with a literal <i>&lt;/a&gt;</i>.Have fun!
00014							20060325		20060325	docelic	docelic@icdevgroup.org		XMLDOCS documentation	Interchange users,For everyone tracking the development of our new documentation (XMLDOCS), it is my pleasure to say we have Interchange pragmas, filters and config directives almost completely documented.The work on reference pages will now focus on the two areas left, namely ITL tags (harder, and more important) and variables (easier, and less important).Have a great day everyone,docelic@icdevgroup.org
00013							20060131		20060131	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Development tree notice	Interchange users,We want to make you aware that as of Jan. 30, 2006, some changes thatbreak compatibility with previous versions of Interchange have been madeto the development version of Interchange in our CVS repository, which isalso the source for our downloadable nightly builds.You should consult the UPGRADE document before putting this in production,and you should check it frequently for changes that might affect yourinstallation. We always strive for the highest compatibility in the stablebranch, so stick with Interchange 5.4.x releases to be safe.Jon JensenInterchange Development Group

Of the many changes, a few highlights include:* Improved pre-fork server model supports even higher traffic.* Extensible architecture improvements allow more customization as wellas removal of unneeded capabilities.* AccumulateCode capability enables more efficient use of memory forproduction systems.* Email enhancements include easy attachment of HTML and files, anddevelopment-mode interception of outgoing mail.* Cart triggers allow custom subroutines to be executed whenever thecart changes.* Better internal XHTML support.* New $Row object provides access to the current list row in embeddedPerl.* DispatchRoutines allows inserting initialization routines withoutmodifying the core.* New demo application called "Standard" improves upon the previous"Foundation" demo.* More payment gateways supported, including an interface to CPAN'sBusiness::OnlinePayment.* More languages are supported by the admin UI.* Of course, many other feature enhancements and bugfixes.The software and a more detailed change log are available here:http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.4/Cryptographic hashes for interchange-5.4.0.tar.gz:MD5: def855c7cfca000ad41f44cd4db83476SHA1: 04acdc39e8ae5d5ba68708b3d1469b0a675deedaWe recommend that this version be used for new development. Many usersof earlier versions of Interchange will want to consider upgrading toInterchange 5.4 after testing it for suitability with their catalogs ina development environment.We'd also like to call your attention to the new Interchange websiteat http://www.icdevgroup.org/ which also links to the new developerdocumentation ("xmldocs").Questions should be directed to the Interchange user discussion mailinglist:interchange-users at icdevgroup.orgWe hope you enjoy using Interchange and find it as useful as we do.Jon JensenInterchange Development Group
