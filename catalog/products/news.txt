Log into our IRC channel #interchange on freenode to follow along or chime in anytime. A full itinerary on Interchange6::Cart TODO and bullet points we wish to discuss will be send out before the end of this week to look over and think about. If you have time available on Monday to dedicate to the hackathon please contact me so we can schedule around you. These talks will be very important for the future functionality of the Interchange6::Cart a critical part of the Interchange6 project. Attendance and/or input do not require any existing knowledge of the Interchange6 code. Your help and support is always greatly appreciated!</p><p>Warm Regards,<br />Sam Batschelet (hexfusion)</p>
00054							20140707		20140707	david	david@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.8.2 stable release	<p>We're pleased to announce the immediate release of Interchange 5.8.2, the latest stable version of Interchange.</p><p>It includes all known bug and security fixes, as well as feature enhancements including Bcrypt as an option for UserDB password security. See the <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.8/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a> file for complete details. We recommend new development be done with this version, and all users of older versions of Interchange should upgrade after testing their catalogs in a test environment.</p><p>Packages are available for <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a> now.</p>
00053							20140624		20140625	mheins	mheins@icdevgroup.org		 Perusion developers release two new Bootstrap based templates for use with Interchange	<p>These templates are meant to be dropped into your existing Interchange directory, and can then be chosen to be used when creating a new catalog (makecat).</p> <p><a href="http://www.perusion.com">Perusion</a> has put up demonstration sites for both versions, which are named <a href="http://demo.perusion.com/i/strap">"Strap"</a> (based on Bootstrap 2.3.2) and <a href="http://demo.perusion.com/i/strap30">"Strap30"</a>(based on Bootstrap 3.1.1). In addition, both templates are available for download or git cloning on Github <a href="https://github.com/perusion">here</a>.</p> <p>Both templates are vast improvements over the older "standard" template currently in use with Interchange. They both are completely <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">HTML5</a> based, include <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a> by default, have been optimized for basic SEO as well as page load speed. Both will display properly with just the Bootstrap.css file, which allows you to simply drop in future Bootstrap css to stay current.</p> <p>There are far too many improvements and changes to list here, so for a more in depth comparison and description of the templates, visit the <a href="http://www.perusion.com/demos.html">demos page</a>.</p>

00044							20110414		20110414	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		IRC Meeting Report	<p>Today we had a <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/news?mv_arg=00043">scheduled developer meeting on IRC</a>, to focus on the future of Interchange. Even before the meeting time arrived, there was good discussion about what the next phase for Interchange will mean. Beforehand, Interchange's team captain, Stefan Hornburg, posted a proposed <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/roadmap">roadmap</a> which people have discussed.</p> <p>Interchange has always been at heart about ecommerce for Perl. That's still an important niche for it to fill, and one close to the hearts of all the current Interchange developer. While Interchange has sometimes been used as a generic application server, there is other software in the Perl world that's better suited for that role these days.</p> <p>One major problem that we would like to solve is that Interchange is little-known in the Perl world at large, and that isn't because it's too new or obscure, but because it's not on CPAN, is a monolithic all-or-nothing system, and doesn't interact well with other Perl web software. We want to make Interchange a good choice for Perl developers doing ecommerce, and make it easier for competent Perl programmers to get results with it quickly.</p> <p>The new Interchange roadmap and IRC discussions define the new Interchange "Bongo" branch's components in rough outline:</p> <ul> <li>No backward compatibility with Interchange 5, though eventually migration helps may be developed</li> <li><a href="http://plackperl.org/">Plack/PSGI</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.perldancer.org/">Dancer</a> and plugins, to cover dispatching, sessions, authentication, etc.</li> <li>Newer Perl versions (5.10.1 or newer)</li> <li>Good unit test coverage, and cpantesters.org testing</li> <li>UTF-8 everywhere</li> <li>Shopping cart, products likely part of core -- it sounds like people want to be database agnostic to allow various SQL, NoSQL, etc., but implementation details here will of course be paramount</li> <li>CPAN modules used wherever possible: <ul> <li>templating: Template::Flute, Template Toolkit, Text::ScriptTemplate, Text::Template, etc.</li> <li>payments: Business::OnlinePayment modules</li> <li>database access: Dancer::Plugin::Database, Rose::DB, DBIx::Class, etc.</li> <li>shipping calculation: Business::Shipping::*</li> </ul> <li>Plug-in architecture for features not always used, such as discounts, coupons, inventory handling, affiliates, reviews, paging (more-list), fragment caching (timed-build)</li> <li>Demo store</li> <li>Same license as Perl: dual GPL + Artistic, as opposed to GPL only for Interchange 5</li> <li>Documentation in POD plus a wiki</li> </ul> <p>Developers who plan to devote time to this include Stefan, me (Jon Jensen), David Christensen, PJ, Marty, ncook, and Justin La Sotten. Jure will help with design and CSS. Testers will include rsdvd, Mat Jones, Gert van der Spoel. And others expect to be able to join in once things get going.</p> <p>We agreed to remove Interchange 5.10, a proposed transitional release, from the roadmap, as many developers didn't see that a transitional release would get used much and would distract from Interchange 6 work. Interchange 5.8 is the next stable release expected in the next few months, and if there's ever a need for a version 5.10 that can be done then.</p> <p>There will be a new Interchange 5.7.7 development release coming very soon.</p> <p>Clearly there's a lot of work to be done, but we haven't seen so many people involved in a developer meeting for a long time, so there's reason to be hopeful.<p>

00042							20100324		20100324	david	david@icdevgroup.org		Interchange security releases: 5.7.6, 5.6.3, 5.4.5	<p>Today we are releasing three new versions of Interchange:</p><ul><li><strong>Interchange 5.7.6</strong> is the latest development version representing all recent improvements and new features to increase developer efficiency and fix bugs.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.6.3</strong> is the latest stable version which includes the most important changes backported to provide the most stability possible for those upgrading from versions 5.6.0, 5.6.1 or 5.6.2.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.4.5</strong> is an update of the previous stable series of releases provided only to fix a serious security problem.</li><p>All three releases close a potential HTTP response splitting vulnerability.  This type of vulnerability can have multiple impacts including cross site scripting, cross-user defacement, web cache poisoning, hijacking pages and browser cache poisoning.  More information about this type of attack vector can be found at <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5WP0E2KFGK.html">http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5WP0E2KFGK.html</a>.</p><p>Catalogs based on the standard demo are not known to be vulnerable out-of-the-box, but there is still the potential of the split response vulnerability impacting custom pages or functionalities.  In particular, if you have enabled either the BounceReferrals or BounceRobotSessionURL directives you may be vulnerable to this attack.</p><p>To protect against exploits, we strongly recommend all public Interchange sites upgrade to the latest point release in the current series.</p>
00041							20100223		20100223	david	david@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.7.5 development release	<p>We're pleased to announce the release of Interchange 5.7.5, the latest development version of Interchange.</p><p>It includes all known bug and security fixes, as well as a few minor new features (see the <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.7/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a> file for details). We recommend new development be done with this version, but only experienced Interchange users should deploy it on production servers.</p><p>Packages are available for <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a> now.</p>
00040							20091209		20091209	david	david@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.7.4 development release	<p>We're pleased to announce the release of Interchange 5.7.4, the latest development version of Interchange.</p><p>It includes all known bug and security fixes, as well as a few minor new features (see the <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.7/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a> file for details). We recommend new development be done with this version, but only experienced Interchange users should deploy it on production servers.</p><p>Packages are available for <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a> now.</p>
00039							20091105		20091105	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.7.3 development release	<p>We're pleased to announce the release of Interchange 5.7.3, the latest development version of Interchange.</p><p>It includes all known bug and security fixes, as well as a few minor new features (see the <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.7/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a> file for details). We recommend new development be done with this version, but only experienced Interchange users should deploy it on production servers.</p><p>This is the first release available in the new XZ compression format, which aims to be the successor to bzip2 (and the short-lived lzma format). Ubuntu 9.10 and Fedora 12 support it, including in GNU tar with the -J option. It offers a smaller download, but is completely optional as far as Interchange is concerned.</p><p>Packages are available for <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a> now.</p>
00038							20090917		20090917	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Interchange security releases: 5.7.2, 5.6.2, 5.4.4	<p>Today we are releasing three new versions of Interchange:</p><ul><li><strong>Interchange 5.7.2</strong> is the latest development version representing 10 months of improvements and an impressive list of new features to improve developer efficiency and fix bugs.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.6.2</strong> is the latest stable version which includes the most important changes backported to provide the most stability possible for those upgrading from versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.4.4</strong> is an update of the previous stable series of releases provided only to fix a security problem.</li></ul><p>All three releases provide a new security feature to close a serious security vulnerability which we will describe here:</p><p>A <strong>remotely exploitable security vulnerability</strong> has been discovered where any table configured within Interchange could be viewed remotely by an unauthenticated user, by using a specially crafted search request.</p><p>This vulnerability affects all previous versions of Interchange. Even without using the search structure provided in the default install, your catalog could still be vulnerable.</p><p><strong>To protect against exploits, we strongly recommend all public Interchange sites upgrade and use the new configuration directive AllowRemoteSearch.</strong></p><p>AllowRemoteSearch limits what database tables are remotely searchable and should be specified in each catalog configuration. It defaults to:</p><pre>AllowRemoteSearch products variants options</pre><p>Any table specified in this option will be remotely searchable, and you should not permit any table with sensitive information to be searched in this way. You should carefully consider the implications of adding any further tables to this configuration option.</p><p>Remote searches may have been used by your existing catalog. These should continue working without any changes as long as they only search tables that are permitted by the AllowRemoteSearch directive. You should carefully examine your catalog for uses of the <tt>search</tt> form action, or pages which submit a form to a page called <tt>search</tt> or <tt>scan</tt>. If they specify a search file other than products, variants, or options, you should consider rewriting that page to just accept the search terms via CGI parameters, and not the entire search. Please consult <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/doc/icdatabase.html#In-Page%20Searches">the documentation on in-page searches</a>.</p><p>If your catalog makes use of ActionMaps that perform searches, these should continue to work as intended as long as they search a table allowed by AllowRemoteSearch. However, you should consider updating them and the <tt>ncheck_category</tt> Sub in catalog.cfg to use the new <tt>search</tt> tag.</p><p>In the standard and foundation catalogs, the "lost password" feature makes use of the remote search feature. We recommend that you delete <tt>catalog/pages/query/get_password.html</tt> from your catalog, and replace <tt>catalog/pages/query/lost_password.html</tt> with an updated version from one of these new releases. As an alternative, see the UPGRADE document for a patch you may apply to work around the problem temporarily.</p><p>For more details see the section "REMOTE SEARCHING" in the <a href="http://git.icdevgroup.org/?p=interchange.git;a=blob;f=UPGRADE;hb=HEAD">UPGRADE document</a>.</p><p>Packages are available on this site for <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a>. We thank Mark Lipscombe for finding and fixing this vulnerability and for his other contributions to these releases.</p>
00037							20090823		20090823	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Next Interchange community meeting	<p>On Tuesday, August 25th, the next Interchange meeting is scheduled to take place on #interchange IRC channel at chat.freenode.net.</p><p>Among the main topics we expect to discuss are:</p><ul><li>Progress update since last meeting</li><li>Promotional efforts regarding Interchange</li><li>Wiki for website</li><li>Roadmap for Interchange / WellWell / icdevgroup.org website</li><li>Clear responsibilities of team members (releases, security, promotions, etc.)</li></ul><p>All Interchange users and the general public are invited.

00036							20090813		20090813	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		David Christensen joins core team	<p>Today the Interchange Development Group welcomes David Christensen to its core team. David has been developing websites with Interchange since 2006, and in the last year or so has become increasingly involved in core development, including UTF-8 support, testing, and troubleshooting. We're pleased to now have David as a committer. Drop by <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/users/community">#interchange on Freenode IRC</a> and congratulate him, and try to stump him with thorny Git questions while you're there. :)</p>
00035							20090812		20090812	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Payflow Pro legacy API retirement on September 1	<p>This is an important note for anyone using the legacy Payflow Pro API for payments. This was formerly owned by Signio, then Verisign, and now is owned by PayPal, but is distinct from their classic PayPal system which is not related.</p><p><a href="https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/gateway_update&mplx=3484-73577-1499-3">On September 1, 2009, the old Payflow Pro API will be shut off</a> and any attempt to take payments or do anything else via that API will fail. This affects all applications using the old API, not just Interchange.</p><p>If you're using the "signio" payment module in Interchange, you should switch to the new "payflowpro" module as soon as possible. You can see the <a href="http://git.icdevgroup.org/?p=interchange.git;a=blob;f=lib/Vend/Payment/PayflowPro.pm;h=0eace1581b85b31b399d7854749144f9e033f014;hb=HEAD">latest version of the Vend::Payment::PayflowPro module</a> in our Git repository and then click on the "raw" link at the top to download it without any extraneous markup.</p><p>If you need assistance in making the switch, use our <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/users/community">Community Resources</a> page to talk with Interchange developers via mailing list or chat, or see the <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/support/index">Professional Support</a> page to find developers for hire who can take care of it for you.</p><p>Most merchants and developers were alerted long ago by PayPal or via other sources, but we wanted to get the word out one last time since only 19 days remain to make the change.</p>
00034							20090525		20090525	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Interchange source code migrated to Git	<p>Tomorrow will be the ninth anniversary of the date when Mike Heins created the Interchange CVS repository to track source code. Nine years!</p><p>In coincidental honor of this anniversary I'm pleased to announce that the Interchange CVS repository has been imported into the Git distributed version control system (thanks to the excellent cvs2git program, part of cvs2svn), and we are now using Git to track changes and are retiring the CVS repository.</p><p>Instructions on accessing the new repository directly with a Git client, using Gitweb, and using our GitHub mirror, are at the <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/i/dev/download">Interchange download page</a>.</p><p>There are many good Git tutorials online, and you can get started at the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">official Git website</a>.</p><p>I encourage serious Interchange users to check out <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. GitHub has become very popular and well-known in the larger Git community because it makes it easy for anyone to set up a free GitHub account, make a GitHub "fork" (personal working copy) of one of the Interchange repositories, and post changes there.</p><p>Then instead of having to send patches through email where they may get mangled and are harder to merge with other changes, you can post them to your GitHub fork. Then one of the Interchange core committers can simply pull down the changes and commit them. Or if your change isn't accepted for some reason, you've still got it in a public place where you can point other people to it, and you can continue to merge ongoing mainline Interchange development with your patch so it stays current.</p><p>For other projects GitHub has helped enable broader community contributions beyond just the core committers, and I hope it can do the same with Interchange. But that will only happen if you take a few minutes to contribute back improvements you make to Interchange!</p><p>You may also be interested in an artificially constructed <a href="http://git.icdevgroup.org/?p=minivend.git;a=summary">repository of old MiniVend and Vend releases</a>. That's just for fun.</p><p>Please report your experiences with the new Git repository on the <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/mailman/listinfo/interchange-users">interchange-users list</a>.</p>

We had a lot of interesting talks at the booth, ran a two hour project workshop and discussed Interchange development day and night.</p><p>The Interchange booth featured a banner across the wall, a big Interchange hanging logo, six-page brochures and a monitor running a slide show. It was well received by the visitors and the LinuxTag project team. Visitors from Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands and other countries were attracted and equipped with an Interchange mug, which was a favorite among the visitors.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who helped Interchange to be present at LinuxTag, especially Jonathan Clark and Gert van der Spoel for covering the expenses. Without their help our presence would be much less notable.</p><p>The second time Interchange exhibited at LinuxTag was a great success and we want to continue this experience next year.

00023							20070618		20070618	racke	racke@icdevgroup.org		New Debian Packages (5.4.2-3)	Apache 1.3 has been removed from Debian unstable, which rendered the libapache-mod-interchange package useless (Debian bug <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/428849">#428849</a>). In answer to this mod_interchange is no longer part of the Debian packages as of the 5.4.2-3 release.
00022							20070613		20070613	racke	racke@icdevgroup.org		Debian Packages for Etch	Packages for Debian 4.0 have been uploaded to www.icdevgroup.org for the i386 architecture, allowing users of Etch to conveniently install or upgrade Interchange on their system.  Also this package release offers a few changes: removed unnecessary Debconf dependency from maintainer script, new (Portuguese) and updated (Russian) Debconf translation.
00021							20070405		20070405	racke	racke@icdevgroup.org		Interchange goes to Linuxtag!	It's time for <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2007/en/">Linuxtag 2007</a>, Europe's leading Linux and Open Source event, and we at Interchange have been invited to operate our own booth alongside other great Open Source projects.

00020							20070227		20070227	kwalsh	kevin@cursor.biz		Ron Phipps joins the Interchange core team	The Interchange development group has welcomed Ron Phipps to its core team.  Ron, an Interchange user since late 2000, has been listed as a contributor for quite some time.

00019							20070207		20070207	racke	racke@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.4.2 released	The Interchange Development Group is pleased to announce the releaseof Interchange 5.4.2, the latest production-ready version of our webapplication server. This is a maintenance release and upgrading fromInterchange 5.4.0 should present no compatibility problems.The main changes are:* Fixed a DoS exploit caused by carefully crafted HTTP POST requests.* Worked around apparent Perl bug that allowed code called by DispatchRoutines to overwrite the routines arrays themselves.* Fixed [sql-quote] sub-tag of the [query] tag, which didn't work for multi-line column data.* Fixed masking of unencrypted credit card numbers to work with a custom MV_CREDIT_CARD_INFO_TEMPLATE that does not match the regexp. Also fixed the regexp so it removes the CVV2 value from the unencrypted data.* Fixed shipping problem with the temporary mv_shipping cart, which could cause trouble in cart recalculations.* Made get_option_hash return a copy when passed a reference.* Don't run check_sub on POSTAUTH for Linkpoint.* Made &amp;and and &amp;or profile commands work when alone on a line between two profile checks.* Increased XHTML compatibility and fixed some CSS.* Various admin, Standard demo, and Debian package fixes.Stefan Hornburg (Racke)Interchange Development Group
00018							20060828		20060828	racke	racke@icdevgroup.org		New Developers pajamian and thunder	Two new developers recently joined the ICDEVGROUP, Peter Ajamian aka pajamian and Gert van der Spoel aka thunder.Peter Ajamian is originally from Southern California and now resides in New Zealand. His Interchange experience dates back till 2002. He helped out several people on the mailing list and supplied a couple of patches for Interchange. Peter's first submission as an Interchange developer was the integration of the NetBilling payment gateway.Gert van der Spoel is a Dutch developer who started with Interchange in 1999. Gert freshly opened up a company in Greece. He contributed the Greek translation for the UI and plans to work on the UTF-8 integration for Interchange.Both are regulars on the interchange IRC channel at irc.icdevgroup.org.
00017							20060526		20060526	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.4.1 released	The Interchange Development Group is pleased to announce the releaseof Interchange 5.4.1, the latest production-ready version of our webapplication server. This is a maintenance release and upgrading fromInterchange 5.4.0 should present no compatibility problems.The main changes are:* Fixed bugs in the ITL parser that can cause an infinite loop whenmalformed ITL opening tags are encountered.* Fixed a regression in htmlarea widget which kept it from working withInternet Explorer and browsers claiming to be compatible.* Fixed a profile parsing bug when a comment immediately precedes the__NAME__ identifier.* Check for "GoogleBot", rather than just "Google", in the default RobotUAlist, to prevent confusion with other UA values such as "GoogleToolbar".* Improvements to Linkpoint and VeriSign payment modules.* Support recent versions of mod_perl 2 in Interchange::Link.* Updated UPS Postal rates in Standard demo's shipping tables.* Numerous minor bugfixes in core code, tags, the admin, and theStandard demo.Jon JensenInterchange Development GroupPGP key: http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/keys/jon-jensen-dccac084.txt
00016							20060328		20060328	docelic	docelic@icdevgroup.org		Improved search system on www.icdevgroup.org	Interchange users,We've improved the searching functionality on our site, http://www.icdevgroup.org/. For example, try searching for 'DisplayErrors' or 'html2text'; you'll notice the result category name in the first column, and an extended description field.For mailing list posts, the mentioned system will also print the date.The majority of work was done by Stefan Hornburg (Racke).Have fun!
00015							20060327		20060327	docelic	docelic@icdevgroup.org		[/page] and [/order] macros	Interchange users,Among other incompatible changes we're preparing for the Interchange 6.0 release, there is one worth the final reminder.Namely, we've removed the [/page] and [/order] macros which were with us for a very long time and do make a piece of Interchange history.The intention to remove them was known a couple of releases back. So if you happen to have used the two macros, replace both of them with a literal <i>&lt;/a&gt;</i>.Have fun!
00014							20060325		20060325	docelic	docelic@icdevgroup.org		XMLDOCS documentation	Interchange users,For everyone tracking the development of our new documentation (XMLDOCS), it is my pleasure to say we have Interchange pragmas, filters and config directives almost completely documented.The work on reference pages will now focus on the two areas left, namely ITL tags (harder, and more important) and variables (easier, and less important).Have a great day everyone,docelic@icdevgroup.org
00013							20060131		20060131	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Development tree notice	Interchange users,We want to make you aware that as of Jan. 30, 2006, some changes thatbreak compatibility with previous versions of Interchange have been madeto the development version of Interchange in our CVS repository, which isalso the source for our downloadable nightly builds.You should consult the UPGRADE document before putting this in production,and you should check it frequently for changes that might affect yourinstallation. We always strive for the highest compatibility in the stablebranch, so stick with Interchange 5.4.x releases to be safe.Jon JensenInterchange Development Group
00012							20051231		20051231	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Interchange 5.4 release	The Interchange Development Group is pleased to announce the releaseof Interchange 5.4, the latest production-ready version of our webapplication server. Of the many changes, a few highlights include:* Improved pre-fork server model supports even higher traffic.* Extensible architecture improvements allow more customization as wellas removal of unneeded capabilities.* AccumulateCode capability enables more efficient use of memory forproduction systems.* Email enhancements include easy attachment of HTML and files, anddevelopment-mode interception of outgoing mail.* Cart triggers allow custom subroutines to be executed whenever thecart changes.* Better internal XHTML support.* New $Row object provides access to the current list row in embeddedPerl.* DispatchRoutines allows inserting initialization routines withoutmodifying the core.* New demo application called "Standard" improves upon the previous"Foundation" demo.* More payment gateways supported, including an interface to CPAN'sBusiness::OnlinePayment.* More languages are supported by the admin UI.* Of course, many other feature enhancements and bugfixes.The software and a more detailed change log are available here:http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.4/Cryptographic hashes for interchange-5.4.0.tar.gz:MD5: def855c7cfca000ad41f44cd4db83476SHA1: 04acdc39e8ae5d5ba68708b3d1469b0a675deedaWe recommend that this version be used for new development. Many usersof earlier versions of Interchange will want to consider upgrading toInterchange 5.4 after testing it for suitability with their catalogs ina development environment.We'd also like to call your attention to the new Interchange websiteat http://www.icdevgroup.org/ which also links to the new developerdocumentation ("xmldocs").Questions should be directed to the Interchange user discussion mailinglist:interchange-users at icdevgroup.orgWe hope you enjoy using Interchange and find it as useful as we do.Jon JensenInterchange Development Group
