00063	20200425	jon	Project website refresh	<p>This Interchange project website has gotten a refresh to its design and organization, to prepare for the Interchange 5.12 release.</p><p>Zed Jensen and Seth Jensen updated the design with a new logo, home page banner, typeface, and more pleasant design. They also added a list of recent commits from GitHub on the home page to give prominent visibility into code changes.</p><p>I updated the site organization to combine the two separate link menu components to make navigation more consistent, and make more important pages easier to reach. The <a href="/i/dev/history">Interchange history page</a> now includes more key events from recent years, and the <a href="/i/dev/news">Interchange news page</a> once again shows history prior to 2005 that was lost in the last site reimplementation.</p><p>If you run into any problems, please let us know by opening a <a href="https://github.com/interchange/interchange/issues">GitHub issue</a>!</p>

00061	20181122	jon	Domain and server move	<p>The Interchange project has moved from the icdevgroup.org domain to the interchangecommerce.org domain. The old domain was familiar and comfortable after being used for 16 years, but we decided to move because the new domain is more self-descriptive of what the Interchange software is all about: ecommerce.</p><p>Hosting for the Interchange project has also moved to a new server. The old server worked faithfully for over 11 years but its software stack had become very outdated. The new server is running Debian 9, the latest pre-release Interchange code from Git, Perl 5.24, MariaDB 10.1, current Mailman, etc.</p><p>The Interchange and related Git repositories have long been mirrored to GitHub, and for several years we have been using GitHub issues for bug reporting. Now we have made GitHub the canonical location for the repositories and retired our own Git and Gitweb services. See the <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a> page for the new URLs to use.</p><p>We have also begun serving the entire site over HTTPS and are using the Cloudflare CDN for DNS, caching, and performance.</p>

00044	20110414	jon	IRC Meeting Report	<p>Today we had a <a href="/i/dev/news?mv_arg=00043">scheduled developer meeting on IRC</a>, to focus on the future of Interchange. Even before the meeting time arrived, there was good discussion about what the next phase for Interchange will mean. Beforehand, Interchange’s team captain, Stefan Hornburg, posted a proposed roadmap which people have discussed.</p> <p>Interchange has always been at heart about ecommerce for Perl. That’s still an important niche for it to fill, and one close to the hearts of all the current Interchange developer. While Interchange has sometimes been used as a generic application server, there is other software in the Perl world that’s better suited for that role these days.</p> <p>One major problem that we would like to solve is that Interchange is little-known in the Perl world at large, and that isn’t because it’s too new or obscure, but because it’s not on CPAN, is a monolithic all-or-nothing system, and doesn’t interact well with other Perl web software. We want to make Interchange a good choice for Perl developers doing ecommerce, and make it easier for competent Perl programmers to get results with it quickly.</p> <p>The new Interchange roadmap and IRC discussions define the new Interchange “Bongo” branch’s components in rough outline:</p> <ul> <li>No backward compatibility with Interchange 5, though eventually migration helps may be developed</li> <li><a href="http://plackperl.org/">Plack/PSGI</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.perldancer.org/">Dancer</a> and plugins, to cover dispatching, sessions, authentication, etc.</li> <li>Newer Perl versions (5.10.1 or newer)</li> <li>Good unit test coverage, and cpantesters.org testing</li> <li>UTF-8 everywhere</li> <li>Shopping cart, products likely part of core — it sounds like people want to be database agnostic to allow various SQL, NoSQL, etc., but implementation details here will of course be paramount</li> <li>CPAN modules used wherever possible: <ul> <li>templating: Template::Flute, Template Toolkit, Text::ScriptTemplate, Text::Template, etc.</li> <li>payments: Business::OnlinePayment modules</li> <li>database access: Dancer::Plugin::Database, Rose::DB, DBIx::Class, etc.</li> <li>shipping calculation: Business::Shipping::*</li> </ul> <li>Plug-in architecture for features not always used, such as discounts, coupons, inventory handling, affiliates, reviews, paging (more-list), fragment caching (timed-build)</li> <li>Demo store</li> <li>Same license as Perl: dual GPL + Artistic, as opposed to GPL only for Interchange 5</li> <li>Documentation in POD plus a wiki</li> </ul> <p>Developers who plan to devote time to this include Stefan, me (Jon Jensen), David Christensen, PJ, Marty, Nick Cook, and Justin La Sotten. Jure will help with design and CSS. Testers will include rsdvd, Mat Jones, Gert van der Spoel. And others expect to be able to join in once things get going.</p> <p>We agreed to remove Interchange 5.10, a proposed transitional release, from the roadmap, as many developers didn’t see that a transitional release would get used much and would distract from Interchange 6 work. Interchange 5.8 is the next stable release expected in the next few months, and if there’s ever a need for a version 5.10 that can be done then.</p> <p>There will be a new Interchange 5.7.7 development release coming very soon.</p> <p>Clearly there’s a lot of work to be done, but we haven’t seen so many people involved in a developer meeting for a long time, so there’s reason to be hopeful.<p>

00042	20100324	david	Interchange security releases: 5.7.6, 5.6.3, 5.4.5	<p>Today we are releasing three new versions of Interchange:</p><ul><li><strong>Interchange 5.7.6</strong> is the latest development version representing all recent improvements and new features to increase developer efficiency and fix bugs.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.6.3</strong> is the latest stable version which includes the most important changes backported to provide the most stability possible for those upgrading from versions 5.6.0, 5.6.1 or 5.6.2.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.4.5</strong> is an update of the previous stable series of releases provided only to fix a serious security problem.</li><p>All three releases close a potential HTTP response splitting vulnerability.  This type of vulnerability can have multiple impacts including cross site scripting, cross-user defacement, web cache poisoning, hijacking pages and browser cache poisoning.  More information about this type of attack vector can be found at <a href="http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5WP0E2KFGK.html">http://www.securiteam.com/securityreviews/5WP0E2KFGK.html</a>.</p><p>Catalogs based on the standard demo are not known to be vulnerable out-of-the-box, but there is still the potential of the split response vulnerability impacting custom pages or functionalities.  In particular, if you have enabled either the BounceReferrals or BounceRobotSessionURL directives you may be vulnerable to this attack.</p><p>To protect against exploits, we strongly recommend all public Interchange sites upgrade to the latest point release in the current series.</p>
00041	20100223	david	Interchange 5.7.5 development release	<p>We’re pleased to announce the release of Interchange 5.7.5, the latest development version of Interchange.</p><p>It includes all known bug and security fixes, as well as a few minor new features (see the <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.7/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a> file for details).

00039	20091105	jon	Interchange 5.7.3 development release	<p>We’re pleased to announce the release of Interchange 5.7.3, the latest development version of Interchange.</p><p>It includes all known bug and security fixes, as well as a few minor new features (see the <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.7/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a> file for details). We recommend new development be done with this version, but only experienced Interchange users should deploy it on production servers.</p><p>This is the first release available in the new XZ compression format, which aims to be the successor to bzip2 (and the short-lived lzma format). Ubuntu 9.10 and Fedora 12 support it, including in GNU tar with the -J option. It offers a smaller download, but is completely optional as far as Interchange is concerned.</p><p>Packages are available for <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a> now.</p>
00038	20090917	jon	Interchange security releases: 5.7.2, 5.6.2, 5.4.4	<p>Today we are releasing three new versions of Interchange:</p><ul><li><strong>Interchange 5.7.2</strong> is the latest development version representing 10 months of improvements and an impressive list of new features to improve developer efficiency and fix bugs.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.6.2</strong> is the latest stable version which includes the most important changes backported to provide the most stability possible for those upgrading from versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1.</li><li><strong>Interchange 5.4.4</strong> is an update of the previous stable series of releases provided only to fix a security problem.</li></ul><p>All three releases provide a new security feature to close a serious security vulnerability which we will describe here:</p><p>A <strong>remotely exploitable security vulnerability</strong> has been discovered where any table configured within Interchange could be viewed remotely by an unauthenticated user, by using a specially crafted search request.</p><p>This vulnerability affects all previous versions of Interchange. Even without using the search structure provided in the default install, your catalog could still be vulnerable.</p><p><strong>To protect against exploits, we strongly recommend all public Interchange sites upgrade and use the new configuration directive AllowRemoteSearch.</strong></p><p>AllowRemoteSearch limits what database tables are remotely searchable and should be specified in each catalog configuration. It defaults to:</p><pre>AllowRemoteSearch products variants options</pre><p>Any table specified in this option will be remotely searchable, and you should not permit any table with sensitive information to be searched in this way. You should carefully consider the implications of adding any further tables to this configuration option.</p><p>Remote searches may have been used by your existing catalog. These should continue working without any changes as long as they only search tables that are permitted by the AllowRemoteSearch directive. You should carefully examine your catalog for uses of the <tt>search</tt> form action, or pages which submit a form to a page called <tt>search</tt> or <tt>scan</tt>. If they specify a search file other than products, variants, or options, you should consider rewriting that page to just accept the search terms via CGI parameters, and not the entire search. Please consult <a href="/doc/icdatabase.html#In-Page%20Searches">the documentation on in-page searches</a>.</p><p>If your catalog makes use of ActionMaps that perform searches, these should continue to work as intended as long as they search a table allowed by AllowRemoteSearch. However, you should consider updating them and the <tt>ncheck_category</tt> Sub in catalog.cfg to use the new <tt>search</tt> tag.</p><p>In the standard and foundation catalogs, the “lost password” feature makes use of the remote search feature. We recommend that you delete <tt>catalog/pages/query/get_password.html</tt> from your catalog, and replace <tt>catalog/pages/query/lost_password.html</tt> with an updated version from one of these new releases. As an alternative, see the UPGRADE document for a patch you may apply to work around the problem temporarily.</p><p>For more details see the section “REMOTE SEARCHING” in the <a href="https://github.com/interchange/interchange/blob/HEAD/UPGRADE">UPGRADE document</a>.</p><p>Packages are available on this site for <a href="/i/dev/download">download</a>.

00036	20090813	jon	David Christensen joins core team	<p>Today the Interchange Development Group welcomes David Christensen to its core team. David has been developing websites with Interchange since 2006, and in the last year or so has become increasingly involved in core development, including UTF-8 support, testing, and troubleshooting. We’re pleased to now have David as a committer. Drop by <a href="/i/dev/users/community">#interchange on Freenode IRC</a> and congratulate him, and try to stump him with thorny Git questions while you’re there. :)</p>
00035	20090812	jon	Payflow Pro legacy API retirement on September 1	<p>This is an important note for anyone using the legacy Payflow Pro API for payments. This was formerly owned by Signio, then Verisign, and now is owned by PayPal, but is distinct from their classic PayPal system which is not related.</p><p><a href="https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=developer/gateway_update&mplx=3484-73577-1499-3">On September 1, 2009, the old Payflow Pro API will be shut off</a> and any attempt to take payments or do anything else via that API will fail. This affects all applications using the old API, not just Interchange.</p><p>If you’re using the “signio” payment module in Interchange, you should switch to the new “payflowpro” module as soon as possible. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/interchange/interchange/blob/HEAD/lib/Vend/Payment/PayflowPro.pm">latest version of the Vend::Payment::PayflowPro module</a> in our Git repository and then click on the “raw” link at the top to download it without any extraneous markup.</p><p>If you need assistance in making the switch, use our <a href="/i/dev/users/community">Community Resources</a> page to talk with Interchange developers via mailing list or chat, or see the <a href="/i/dev/support/index">Professional Support</a> page to find developers for hire who can take care of it for you.</p><p>Most merchants and developers were alerted long ago by PayPal or via other sources, but we wanted to get the word out one last time since only 19 days remain to make the change.</p>
00034	20090525	jon	Interchange source code migrated to Git	<p>Tomorrow will be the ninth anniversary of the date when Mike Heins created the Interchange CVS repository to track source code. Nine years!</p><p>In coincidental honor of this anniversary I’m pleased to announce that the Interchange CVS repository has been imported into the Git distributed version control system (thanks to the excellent cvs2git program, part of cvs2svn), and we are now using Git to track changes and are retiring the CVS repository.</p><p>Instructions on accessing the new repository directly with a Git client, using Gitweb, and using our GitHub mirror, are at the <a href="/i/dev/download">Interchange download page</a>.</p><p>There are many good Git tutorials online, and you can get started at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/">official Git website</a>.</p><p>I encourage serious Interchange users to check out <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. GitHub has become very popular and well-known in the larger Git community because it makes it easy for anyone to set up a free GitHub account, make a GitHub “fork” (personal working copy) of one of the Interchange repositories, and post changes there.</p><p>Then instead of having to send patches through email where they may get mangled and are harder to merge with other changes, you can post them to your GitHub fork. Then one of the Interchange core committers can simply pull down the changes and commit them. Or if your change isn’t accepted for some reason, you’ve still got it in a public place where you can point other people to it, and you can continue to merge ongoing mainline Interchange development with your patch so it stays current.</p><p>For other projects GitHub has helped enable broader community contributions beyond just the core committers, and I hope it can do the same with Interchange. But that will only happen if you take a few minutes to contribute back improvements you make to Interchange!</p><p>You may also be interested in an artificially constructed <a href="https://github.com/interchange/minivend">repository of old MiniVend and Vend releases</a>. That’s just for fun.</p><p>Please report your experiences with the new Git repository on the <a href="/mailman/listinfo/interchange-users">interchange-users list</a>.</p>

00032	20090513	jon	Experimental UTF-8 branch	<p>David Christensen has been working on improving Interchange’s UTF-8 support that has had compatibility trouble with Safe, performance, and in some other areas, and is maintaining changes not yet ready for mainline Interchange in his <a href="https://github.com/machack666/interchange-utf8">GitHub fork</a>. If you’re having any trouble with UTF-8 in Interchange, please give his changes a try and let us know on the interchange-users mailing list.</p>

We had a lot of interesting talks at the booth, ran a two hour project workshop and discussed Interchange development day and night.</p><p>The Interchange booth featured a banner across the wall, a big Interchange hanging logo, six-page brochures and a monitor running a slide show. It was well received by the visitors and the LinuxTag project team. Visitors from Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands and other countries were attracted and equipped with an Interchange mug, which was a favorite among the visitors.</p><p>Thanks to everyone who helped Interchange to be present at LinuxTag, especially Jonathan Clark and Gert van der Spoel for covering the expenses. Without their help our presence would be much less notable.</p><p>The second time Interchange exhibited at LinuxTag was a great success and we want to continue this experience next year. We hope to see more developers and users join us in sharing ideas with us. Therefore we will offer 2009 an extended workshop targeted specifically at our users.</p><p>Booth Team:<br>Stefan Hornburg (Germany), Jon Jensen (End Point, USA), Ton Verhagen (Alamerce, Netherlands), Davor Ocelić (Spinlock, Croatia), Jure Kodžoman (Tenalt, Slovenia), Sebastian Kliess (MBS, Germany), Falk Neubert (Ecoservice, Germany).</p><p>Sponsors:<br>Jonathan Clark, Webmaint, Great Britain<br>Gert van der Spoel, Greece/Netherlands</p>

This affects catalogs built on the ‘mike’, ‘standard’, or ‘foundation’ demo included with Interchange from version 4.9.3 (development) and 5.0 (stable). Two vulnerability database entries cover this: <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3072">CVE-2005-3072</a> and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3073">CVE-2005-3073</a>.</p><p>The Interchange Development Group recommends that all vulnerable catalogs are immediately patched with the updated version of the forum/submit.html file. Alternatively, if the forum feature is not being used, the page can safely be removed. Whether or not the forum feature is being used, this page should be patched or removed.</p><p>Updated releases of Interchange: <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.0/tar/">5.0.2</a> and <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.2/tar/">5.2.1</a> are available, RPM versions will follow.</p><p>The <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/nightly_build/">nightly build</a> now also includes the fix.</p>

B006	20021219	mheins	Interchange Documentation Wiki	<p>Jon Jensen and I have thought about doing this ever since we did an Intranet based on Interchange. I finally decided to take the leap and try out an Interchange Documentation Wiki.</p><p>You can edit any item in there simply by creating an account and wailing away. We will be watching all changes to the core documentation at <a href="/mailman/listinfo/docs">docs@icdevgroup.org</a>, and merging in the good changes to the actual IC 5.0 documentation.</p><p>Those of you who have wanted to work on something but didn’t feel you had the time to start learning the SDF docs for Interchange can now work casually in the much simpler POD format. And you can add links to your favorite supplemental information as well.</p><p>Try the Wiki concept, you’ll like it!</p>
B007	20021212	mheins	interchange.rtfm.info	<p>Some of you may have already run across Kevin Walsh’s fine <a href="http://interchange.rtfm.info/">interchange.rtfm.info</a> site. It is an excellent clearinghouse for information about Interchange, and is a must-see for anyone who has questions about Interchange.</p><p>Kevin also hosts the Interchange IRC channel, which has frequent visitors of all types.</p>
B008	20021212		Interchange 4.9.5 Released	<p>ICDEVGROUP announces the release of Interchange 4.9.5. It is a bugfix release to correct problems with 4.9.4, and has just a couple of new features.</p><p>Notable:</p><ul><li>Add component files in for new selectable results-list done by Ton. This fixes a "no search results" problem seen in 4.9.4.</li><li>Make proper patches to history-scan and barlink() to work with Randy Moore’s category_vert_toggle component.</li><li>Fixed problem with PreFork and mod_perl modes where Interchange children kept order profile state between runs.</li><li>A number of refinements and fixes to Menu module. Fixes improper state keeping for tree-based components.</li><li>Simplify field_settor subroutines with prepared query and placeholders. Prevents infamous DBD::Pg::do errors.</li></ul><p>A complete list is available in <a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a>.</p><p>Distribution available at:</p><blockquote><h3>TAR</h3><a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/tar/interchange-4.9.5.tar.gz">http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/tar/interchange-4.9.5.tar.gz</a><h3>RPM</h3><a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/rpm/">http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/rpm/</a><h3>SRPM</h3><a href="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/srpm/">http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/srpm/</a></blockquote><p>All questions and inquiries should be directed to Interchange’s fine user mail list: <a href="/mailman/listinfo/interchange-users">interchange-users@icdevgroup.org</a></p>
B009	20021202	mheins	Interchange 4.9.4 released	<p>ICDEVGROUP is <a href="/pipermail/interchange-announce/2002/000034.html">happy to announce</a> the release of Interchange 4.9.4. It is the best Interchange available today.</p><p>All people using the 4.9.3 nightly builds as a basis for their development should standardize on this version and not update routinely from the nightly_build tree. The next round of nightly builds and CVS checkouts will start to be unstable in the UI area, as a major update to page logic and page look-and-feel is in progress.</p> <UL> <LI> New survey and mailforms generator allows you to point and click your way to a poll, survey, or feedback form including an optional "wizard" look and feel.  <LI> Payment settlement functions for post-auth and void are now supported in the UI, and the order status update functions are easier and more visually pleasing.  <LI> Forum feature allows commments and reviews by users.  <LI> Tabbed-display tag allows easy creation of tabbed entries on a page — portable for Mozilla, MSIE 5.5+, and Opera 7.  <LI> New UI look and feel. This is a taste of what is to come; some very professional HTML design is still ongoing, and Interchange is not done yet in that regard.  </UL><p> The WHATSNEW document has a large list of changes:</p><p> While officially it is still in alpha release, the code is quite stable and the various nightly builds of 4.9.3 are in wide use in production. THe alpha status is because the UI interface is changing so rapidly. The customer-facing code is very stable and in most ways is better than the stable 4.8.6 branch.</p><p> The code is available at the ICDEVGROUP site:</p> <DL> <DT>TAR</DT> <DD> <A HREF="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/tar/interchange-4.9.4.tar.gz"> http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/tar/interchange-4.9.4.tar.gz </a> </DD> <DT>RPM</DT> <DD> <A HREF="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/rpm/"> http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/rpm/ </a> </DD> <DT>SRPM</DT> <DD> <A HREF="http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/srpm/"> http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/4.9/srpm/ </a> </DD> </DL>
100076	20021114		Order Fulfillment: The E-Commerce Deal Breaker	<p>There is an interesting <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&ncid=620&e=2&cid=620&u=/nf/20021114/bs_nf/19974">story</a> from <a href="http://www.CRMDaily.com">CRM Daily</A> (via <a href="http://news.yahoo.com">Yahoo! News</a>) that talks about the fulfillment process and how many e-commerce software packages have a hard time handling the process.</p><p>Many of you may not know that Interchange works well as a platform for delivering on CRM processes. The <a href="/interchange-doc-5.2.0/icdatabase.html#Order%20Routing">order routing facility</a> of Interchange allows many custom actions upon order, and the built-in order database can be updated to reflect real-time status. Since it uses standard SQL, external programs can update status as well.</p>
B010	20021028	mheins	Some docs for Interchange 4.9	<p>We have put up some <a href="/doc-5.0/">documentation for Interchange 4.9/5.0</a>. They have some of the new features in there, but of course not everything is covered.</p><p>We encourage anyone who is using IC 5.0 to contribute pieces of documentation, especially context-sensitive help for the Admin UI.</p>
100061	20021028	mheins	Interchange on front cover of Linux Magazine	<p>Interchange <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021108022804/http://www.alamerce.nl/images/LinuxCover50.jpg">made the front cover</a> of the October 2002 edition of <a href="https://www.linuxmag.nl/">Linux Magazine</a> — in Dutch. It is a four-page feature article by Interchange core group member Ton Verhagen.</p>
100050	20021026	mheins	Whither Red Hat?	<p>Some folks at <a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat</a> are telling people that they have “phased out” Interchange, and this is causing some confusion.</p><p>To make this absolutely clear, Red Hat has changed corporate direction to focus more on the enterprise, and Interchange didn’t fit those plans. They have stopped directly supporting Interchange. Personally, I wish they would just release an official statement on it....</p><p>Interchange itself is far from phased out. Anyone who has looked at <a href="/i/dev/demo">the latest demo</a> or waded through the 1500+ monthly messages on the mail list can see that. The users and core developers of ICDEVGROUP are hard at work. One of the neat things about the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> GPL is that software cannot die other than from lack of interest. There is no lack of interest in Interchange.</p>
