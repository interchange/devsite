00014							20060325		20060325	docelic	docelic@icdevgroup.org		XMLDOCS documentation	Interchange users,For everyone tracking the development of our new documentation (XMLDOCS), it is my pleasure to say we have Interchange pragmas, filters and config directives almost completely documented.The work on reference pages will now focus on the two areas left, namely ITL tags (harder, and more important) and variables (easier, and less important).Have a great day everyone,docelic@icdevgroup.org
00013							20060131		20060131	jon	jon@icdevgroup.org		Development tree notice	Interchange users,We want to make you aware that as of Jan. 30, 2006, some changes thatbreak compatibility with previous versions of Interchange have been madeto the development version of Interchange in our CVS repository, which isalso the source for our downloadable nightly builds.You should consult the UPGRADE document before putting this in production,and you should check it frequently for changes that might affect yourinstallation. We always strive for the highest compatibility in the stablebranch, so stick with Interchange 5.4.x releases to be safe.Jon JensenInterchange Development Group

Of the many changes, a few highlights include:* Improved pre-fork server model supports even higher traffic.* Extensible architecture improvements allow more customization as wellas removal of unneeded capabilities.* AccumulateCode capability enables more efficient use of memory forproduction systems.* Email enhancements include easy attachment of HTML and files, anddevelopment-mode interception of outgoing mail.* Cart triggers allow custom subroutines to be executed whenever thecart changes.* Better internal XHTML support.* New $Row object provides access to the current list row in embeddedPerl.* DispatchRoutines allows inserting initialization routines withoutmodifying the core.* New demo application called "Standard" improves upon the previous"Foundation" demo.* More payment gateways supported, including an interface to CPAN'sBusiness::OnlinePayment.* More languages are supported by the admin UI.* Of course, many other feature enhancements and bugfixes.The software and a more detailed change log are available here:http://ftp.icdevgroup.org/interchange/5.4/Cryptographic hashes for interchange-5.4.0.tar.gz:MD5: def855c7cfca000ad41f44cd4db83476SHA1: 04acdc39e8ae5d5ba68708b3d1469b0a675deedaWe recommend that this version be used for new development. Many usersof earlier versions of Interchange will want to consider upgrading toInterchange 5.4 after testing it for suitability with their catalogs ina development environment.We'd also like to call your attention to the new Interchange websiteat http://www.icdevgroup.org/ which also links to the new developerdocumentation ("xmldocs").Questions should be directed to the Interchange user discussion mailinglist:interchange-users at icdevgroup.orgWe hope you enjoy using Interchange and find it as useful as we do.Jon JensenInterchange Development Group
